# Blackjack Simulator 
Attempting to simulate rounds of blackjack to check true house edges. Conventional knowledge says that the house edge can go anywhere from 2% to .5% depending on the variation and if the player is using basic strategy. This repo will attempt to run simulations to see if this number is accurate.

How to run: 
Pull the repo and npm install it. Then run ts-node main.js on the root directory level. 

Future steps:
1. Need to work out some minor bugs
2. Add more configs for different house rules
3. Maybe add a graph component or frontend?
